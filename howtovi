General Rules
Many commands are known as operators. When they are followed by a space and then another command, that one is a motion. 
Motions modify operators. Many operators can have a count, a number in front that shows how often the command will be executed in series.
to quit :q (that takes you out of the current section, like help, so you may need to repeat it)
to insert text i (or a [append], or I [append start of line], or A [append end of line])
to insert a line o for a new line below current, O for a new line above current
to return to command mode hit Esc - this will also escape from a command, cancelling it
Last-line Mode is :
to write (save) w
to quit without saving put q! - the ! is an override, it won't quit otherwise because you have unsaved material
Enter executes commands

in Insert mode 
Home goes to first letter in a line
End goes to the end of a line
Arrow keys all work

In command mode
Arrow keys work but letters can be faster - j down, k up, h left, l right
w will jump to the first letter of each successive word, a count in front jumps n words
b jumps back to the first letter of each previous word,
e jumps to the end of each successive word
$ takes you to the end  of a line,
0 takes you to the start of a line, 
H takes you to the top of the screen (High), 
M to the middle,
L to the bottom (low),
ctrl f to go forwards a page, ctrl b to go backwards a page,
G is go, it will go to the beginning the last line of a doc, a number followed by G goes to the beginning of that line number
gg goes to the beginning of the doc

Deleting 
In command mode, 
x deletes to the right, X to the left, dw deletes a word, to then delete various words repeat by pressing '.'
delete everything preceding the cursor on one line d0
delete everything following the cursor on one line d$
delete a whole line dd
delete a given number of lines by putting a number in front of dd, like 5dd
All commands are repeated in Command Mode by pressing the period, '.'

Undo
u undoes the last command, U will 'fix a whole line', returning it to the state before you started altering it
ctrl r to redo commands

Copy and Paste
when you delete something it is stored (that's why you can undo) so it can be put somewhere else. 
p is 'put', or 'paste', it will place the last thing deleted where the cursor is. When pasting lines it puts them on a new line below the current cursor location.
v puts you in visual mode, in which you can highligt text by moving around the cursor
y is 'yank', which functions like copy

Editing Command Mode 
r replaces the character under the cursor with the next character you type 
c is change, this operator can take motions and counts like d - so c5w removes the following 5 words, c$ changes the remainder of the line
ce removed the characters following the cursor in that word and puts you in Insert mode to replace them

Search
/ followed by a phrase searches forward in the doc for that: eg, /what do i know searches for that phrase following the cursor
add n (next) to search again, N to search in the opposite direction
? followed by a phrase does the same but searches backwards in the doc
Ctrl o goes to the last place in the doc where you executed a command, repeating will take you further back in time. 
Ctrl i goes forwards in the same way.
% will search for the partner to the currently highlighted bracket, be it (), [], or {}

Substitute
This is one of the commands that follows a colon, meaning it is shown at the bottom of the terminal and can be edited 
:s means substitute. Then you put /old term, /new term eg :s/frack/fuck
if you tack on /g at the end, that means global, and all instances will be replaced in that line. If not only the first is changed.
:s/old/new - change first instance in line where cursor is
:s/old/new/g - change all instances in that line
:#,#s/old/new/g - change all instances in lines # through #
:%s/old/new/g - change all instances in whole doc
:%s/old/new/gc - find every instance, prompt with each with option to substitute or skip

Execute external command 
:! then the command, like ls, then enter
