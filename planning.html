		 <p class="intro">
		 We're building the first draft now. 
		 It develops how to build an extensive permanent colony on the Moon. 
		 The main thing is that this is a vision of what could be done if there was a serious drive for settlement, 
		 where a group of nations considered it important enough to devote significant funds to the task.  
		 Cernan's Promise is the seed of much, much greater things. 
		 Its goals are permanence, scale, flexibility, and ecosystem creation. 
		 <br><br>
		 <span style="font-weight: 400italic; color: yellow;">
		 This is a collaborative project open to anyone who can pitch in.
		 If you are interested in participating, leave a message in the forum or email me, kim@moonwards.com. You 
		 can also go to the <a href="https://github.com/briligg/moonwards">GitHub page</a>. 
		 Another interesting window is the project's <a href="https://realtimeboard.com/app/board/o9J_k0iGgz4=/">
		 Realtimeboard</a> entries. Input is always welcome.  
		 What should be added here? What needs improving? What would you like to work on? What do you think?</span><br><br>
		 <i>Note May 14 2016 - This page has stalled a little as i try to figure out how best to use it. A lot of 
		 what it was meant to do has now been taken over by the GitHub and RealTimeBoard pages mentioned above. I have 
		 in fact built several new models over the last few months, and developed plans together with others. 
		 You can see most of them at my <a href="https://sketchfab.com/briligg">Sketchfab account</a>, though many 
		 have yet to be configured and annotated. I am about to leave for the<a href="http://isdc.nss.org/2016/#/">
		  International Space Development 
		 Conference</a>, where i give 3 presentations this year. I can at least say that they will see these new 
		 models and updated plans. When i get back, i'll settle down to updating everything here. Thank you for 
		 your patience. :)</i>

			 	<p><strong>Installations and Equipment:</strong> 
			 	To maximize the utility of a limited amount of machinery and supplies, these are the 
			 	design principles:
			 	</p>
			 		<ul class="roundAll dark" >
			 			<li><strong>Modular</strong> - Everything that can be shared around, will be. Design things that can be 
			 			dropped quickly and easily into a number of machines for a quick repair, added capacity, or specialized ability. 
			 			</li>
			 			<li><strong>Light</strong> - Use not only materials with the best density and strength for the lightest 
			 			design, but also always look for ways to use local materials - rocks and soil for stability, insulation, or 
			 			thermal mass, for instance. Remember that many pieces will arrive on the 2nd mission and there could be 
			 			opportunities to have very simple structural elements be provided by materials made by the 1st mission.
			 			</li>
			 			<li><strong>Simple</strong> - Low part count, simplest possible technology. Electric or mechanical actuators instead of 
			 			hydraulic, for example. Design parts that can be replaced with parts fabricated on site where possible - 3d 
			 			printed with sintered metal powder or made of fused basalt.
			 			</li>
			 			<li><strong>Feasible</strong> - Everything needs to be designed and developed, but don't use a technology 
			 			unless there is high confidence it would be available to a real colony. It is reasonable to assume more agile 
			 			and powerful robotics, for instance, but don't bet on fusion power.

		 	 			<span>This station focuses sunlight on powder regolith to melt it. Round lenses 
		 	 			focus to a point, square ones to a line. The linear lenses can melt a sheet 
		 	 			of regolith by scanning across a surface, the point lenses can melt more precisely and quickly.
		 	 			Fresnel lenses are perfect for this job. They can be only a few mm thick. Sapphire 
		 	 			is a great material for them, letting through a wide spectrum of light including UV and 
		 	 			near IR, high melting point of 2030 <sup>o</sup>C, highly resistant to scratching 
		 	 			with a Mohs scale of 9, and very low thermal expansion. The ability to produce  
		 	 			sapphire on the Moon is a high priority, so that lenses and glazing materials can then be 
		 	 			made on site.

		 	 			<span>The motors, in red, travel along the rails and have a ball joint connected to the base of 
		 	 			the lens arms. The ball joint could be motorized as well, and the two motors given a set of
		 	 			programs so they can be set to track the sun such that it stays focused on one spot, or the 
		 	 			focal point moved along a given path at a given rate. 
		 	 			For these arms on the free-form MIP section, they should also probably be programmed 
		 	 			to not stop suddenly, but slow down smoothly, to minimize oscillating movements of a lens 
		 	 			when it comes to a stop. A box around the parts limits the entry of dust. Joints will need 
		 	 			to be sealed, which may mean a ball joint is less practical.

		 	 		<button class="issues tooltipT" style="top: 62%; left: 45%;">3
		 	 			<span>The joints for the arm have been sketched in only roughly. Probably the lens end of the 
		 	 			arm also needs to be able to rotate around both the vertical and horizontal axes, and also to 
		 	 			telescope its length. 
		 	 			This is so the light from lenses can be used either highly focused or 
		 	 			only partially focused, and the lens can reach a larger area. What is shown isn't sufficient 
		 	 			for that. 
		 	 			</span>
		 	 		</button>
		 	 		<button class="issues tooltipML" style="top: 14%; left: 73%;">4
		 	 			<span>The frame of the lens for the fixed MIP bed has blades along its top and bottom edge 
		 	 			for levelling the powder regolith delivered by the rovers into a smooth, flat layer. This 
		 	 			lens rides on rails on both sides, for smoother movement. The arms on this lens 
		 	 			are also a very rough sketch. The lens needs to be able to spin a half circle around the 
		 	 			axis between the arms attached to its frame, and keep a steady angle while an end blade is 
		 	 			dragged across the regolith.

		 	 			<span>Not yet shown: flaps on either side of the frames of square lenses that can slide across
		 	 			the width of the lens and rotate. Such flaps would allow light from parts of the lens 
		 	 			to be blocked dynamically, with continuous adjustment. 
		 	 			Because square lenses focus to a line, by working in conjunction from the sides of the 
		 	 			frame these two flaps could 
		 	 			accurately narrow or widen 
		 	 			the section of that line falling on the regolith, and slide it from side to side.
		 	 			By sliding across the frame and rotating, they could instead shade one or two sections of the 
		 	 			line, and widen or narrow it continuously. This allows the fixed bed to create much more 
		 	 			complex shapes than it otherwise could. Because it can also build up objects layer by layer 
		 	 			(with the help of the rovers), it thus becomes a 3d printer in basalt, albeit at a coarse scale. 
		 	 			Considering the great simplicity, ruggedness, and light mass of the system, that is a huge 
		 	 			advantage.

		 	 			<span>This pile of material represents what is excavated during construction of 
		 	 			the dugout and sunken hall. Some portion of it could be useful as an additional 
		 	 			feedstock for the MIPs, so the two are side by side. This material could be very 
		 	 			chunky and hard to break up. Even though the bulk of it will be fine-grain regolith, 
		 	 			it is the stuff that is hard-packed under the lunar surface. Only experimentation 
		 	 			will show how easily such material crumbles. Stuff that can't be efficiently reduced 
		 	 			to a fine powder can't be used for certain processes. It won't melt evenly.

		 	 			<span>These shadows should contain really bright areas where the sun is focused - 
		 	 			that will come. At that time a path along this fixed MIP bed will also be drawn 
		 	 			that glows molten red near the lens and darkens farther away where it has had 
		 	 			time to cool. It will take trial and error to determine many things: how long it takes for 
		 	 			the regolith to cool and harden, what the maximum thickness of the melt sheet 
		 	 			can be to produce amorphous basalt with glass properties, what the temperature range 
		 	 			is for the basalt to be thickened enough to form strings, or to behave like a putty, or 
		 	 			to be cut into sections without running back together or sticking excessively to the 
		 	 			cutting blade (probably of graphite).

		 	 			<span>This is an old image, the first draft of the MIP, but it shows 
		 	 			its structural supports well. Mission designs have always gone with 
		 	 			one or two self-contained units that do everything on-board. The 
		 	 			framework of the VMC's approach - tele-operation, ongoing launches, 
		 	 			large payload size - allows structures like this to be built, and 
		 	 			they solve a lot of problems. Now moving parts are well above the 
		 	 			dust, precise actions can be executed over a very large area, a 
		 	 			multitude of units can take advantage of a common structure to 
		 	 			work simultaneously, and their motors don't have to be as 
		 	 			complicated or rugged. The payload mass and volume taken up to achieve this 
		 	 			is very low, and the structure is easy for the rovers to assemble. 
		 	 			The cables shown here are of course much thicker than they need to be, 
		 	 			otherwise they would be invisible.

		 	 			<span>This is a variant on square lenses that has sections which can 
		 	 			rotate enough to narrow the band of focused light up to 75%. It 
		 	 			would need three motors just to do that and it may not have much 
		 	 			application. Perhaps it will be dropped.

			 	<p><strong>Structures:</strong> This is a permanent colony. Build for growth and for the ages:
			 	</p>
			 	<ul class="roundAll dark">
			 		<li><strong>Low Radiation</strong> - The maximum annual dose for long-term lunar residents 
			 		shall be taken as 0.05 Sv/year, which is the maximum dose permitted for nuclear plant workers. 
			 		Values for cosmic radiation on the lunar surface are estimated only as adequate data is lacking. 
			 		Taking currently used values, the maximum dose is not exceeded if 700 g/cm<sup>2</sup> of 
			 		regolith is between people and the sky. There are many wrinkles to this, some of that 
			 		is discussed as part of the radiation blind glazing design used over dugouts. In the most 
			 		general terms, some values can be simplified. Time spent in areas shielded on all 
			 		sides by at least 1000 g/cm<sup>2</sup> 
			 		have doses low enough they need not be considered. Time spent outside in a space suit or vehicle 
			 		shall for now be taken as an average value of 0.4 Sv/year in consideration of secondary 
			 		radiation. When estimating the dose in an area, locate its center, and calculate what 
			 		portion of the surface area of a sphere is exposed to the different dose levels 
			 		within it. For instance, a window under an overhang with a view down into Lalande Crater 
			 		will give a small radiation dose to people standing in front of it due to the 
			 		secondary radiation cosmic rays create on the lunar surface. That would be significantly 
			 		less than direct exposure, but still needs to be considered. But if that window is 
			 		at the end of a sunken hall, most of that person's surroundings present them with no 
			 		radiation dose, effectively. So, the expected dose from the direction of the window would 
			 		be multiplied by whatever fraction of that sphere surface area it takes up for that person. 
			 		When estimating overall dose, to get the true yearly dose, multiply the doses in different areas by 
			 		the fraction of time spent there on average, and add the results for all areas. 
		 			</li>
		 			<li><strong>70% Earth Atmosphere</strong> - To reduce the burden on building structures, 
		 			the atmosphere used can be 70% that on Earth, which is 10 psi, 70 kPa, or 700 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. 
		 			Because the gravity is 1/6th of Earth's, it would take 6 times as much material to offset that 
		 			pressure with sheer mass - 4200 g/cm<sup>2</sup> if it was pressing down from above. In cases 
		 			such as windows, other glazing, and airlocks, the pressure must be contained entirely by materials 
		 			under tension. Basalt cable and fabric can be used for this. Solid basalt materials built up 
		 			layer by layer or cast from lava can also have good strength in tension if they are 
		 			cooled to have a glass structure. In areas excavated out of packed regolith and rock, some portion 
		 			of the pressure can be born by the ground. We don't have data as to how much, for cases where the 
		 			shortest distance to the outside contains less than that 4200 g/cm<sup>2</sup> figure. Interiors of 
		 			such areas are lined with basalt tiles and then parged with lava in current designs. Ceilings are 
		 			reinforced with arches that may need to contain basalt cable in order to bear the tension load.
		 			</li>
		 			<li><strong>Lots of Sun</strong> - People will live here long-term. Make it a pleasant place to be. 
		 			Living in artificial lighting is depressing. There should be enough sunlight for most plants to grow, simply  
		 			for comfort, as well as to have plants. Light received indirectly by reflection, windows that are 
		 			recessed enough or have a large enough overhang to have no view of the sky, and radiation blind 
		 			glazing are 
		 			three options. Reflected light can use parabolic mirrors to concentrate sunlight so that lots can 
		 			come in through a small opening. During solar flares, areas that receive sunlight directly - radiation 
		 			blind glazed areas - will receive dangerous doses of radiation. A sheltered area must always be connected 
		 			to such glazed areas so people and plants can be moved quickly to safety when a flare alarm occurs. 
		 			</li>
		 			<li><strong>Thermal Mass</strong> - Noon is really hot, midnight is really, really cold. But the sun 
		 			is only about 30% stronger than full sun on Earth, 
		 			just without an atmosphere or water to hold and redistribute its heat. If you give it enough 
		 			mass to soak into, temperatures will stay within a comfortable range with little to no heat control equipment. 
		 			If enough sun to grow plants is admitted structures will require lots of such mass. 
		 			The favored approach is design of heat islands. This is discussed further in the 
		 			image set for sunken halls. 
		 			Basically, once the way heat diffuses through the ground is understood, a heat budget can be designed 
		 			for a structure of a given geometry. A balance needs to be struck between the amount of heat that 
		 			will enter as sunlight or soak through structures not thermally isolated from the surface, 
		 			the surface area within habitats that this heat is then distributed to, and the volume of material 
		 			beyond them the heat will diffuse into. 
		 			</li>
		 			<li><strong>Build Big</strong> - As big as possible. With the above requirements satisfied, the task is to 
		 			figure out how to build a structure with the largest possible volume with available resources. For people 
		 			living here, these buildings are both their indoors and their outdoors. We are assuming that people will 
		 			venture out onto the surface of the Moon only very little. Since robots are being used to build the entire 
		 			colony, it is probable that the vast majority of tasks could be efficiently accomplished by residents 
		 			tele-operating those robots from within habitats. Especially if that system includes a quality virtual 
		 			reality interface, people would tend to prefer that over putting on a bulky, uncomfortable spacesuit 
		 			that restricts their mobility so much it makes them quite clumsy, and exposing themselves to high radiation 
		 			outside. So very large open spaces are a critical element of habitat designs. Other than personal spaces 
		 			such as homes and offices, which can benefit from a cozy feel, everything should be on a much bigger 
		 			scale than on Earth. Ceilings should be at least 5 or 6 m high, halls extra wide, large open areas always 
		 			nearby. A good starting point is the interior design of large shopping malls. 
		 			</li>
		 			<li><strong>Create Views</strong> - Though it comes last, this makes the list. 
		 			Being in a restricted space is 
		 			crazy-making. Windows must exist, but must be recessed or covered by an overhang in order to 
		 			reduce radiation. Direct views of the sky are possible within areas with radiation blind 
		 			glazed roofs. Views of the Earth should be spread through every hab, magnified where possible. 
		 			Gardens need to be landscaped and have lots of different plants. While clutter and busy designs make 
		 			spaces feel smaller, putting in a large number of small items that are very detailed gives a sense 
		 			that the space contains more. Small figurines or models can be incorporated around doorways, shelves, 
		 			and posts, and tucked among plants. Bas-reliefs in a single material would be effective, as their single 
		 			color prevents them from making spaces feel cluttered, while the images add visual richness.
