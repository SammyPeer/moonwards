				Deep change comes from new experiences. New places bring new perspectives. Space is the ultimate place for both, 
				and there is no place in space like the Moon. It can change everything, and it will, once we understand that and 
				act on it.
				</p>
				<p>
				There are any number of worthy goals that could be accomplished if only we stopped directing so much time and 
				money to fighting, showing off, and unhealthy distractions. Though a Moon colony might seem low on the list, it 
				will take something like it to snap us out of the petty differences, self-fulfilling fears, and 
				quiet despair that hold us back. A place that was never a part of any of that thinking can shake us out of it. 
				It is bigger than that. By reaching it, we showed ourselves we can be bigger than that too. By watching people 
				live there, the thought would grow in us day by day - all our assumptions come from a tiny speck in a vast 
				universe. The air, the dirt, the sun, the sky, the very force that holds us to the ground - outside of this 
				speck it all changes, and varies endlessly with each new place. That thought is a seed around which new ideas 
				of inclusion and acceptance can crystallize. Nothing on Earth can make that argument with anything near the same 
				power.
				</p>
				<p>
				And the Moon is there for all of us. It has always been that way, and must always be so. It is time for us to 
				come to think of ourselves as a single unit - humanity, all further divisions minor footnotes. This is much 
				easier to see from the surface of the Moon. It is important that we go there together, and work there together, 
				no exclusions. Far from Earth, we can act as children do, free of subtexts of nation, culture, and creed 
				that affect all interchanges here at home, because everything is new. That is one of the magical things about 
				science - it has no politics, no religion, and its language is the purity of math. On the Moon, belief in science 
				above all will be natural - because it is keeping you alive. Those who go there will be icons, we will watch their 
				every move. They will pass that belief in science back to the millions watching at home. Again, with a power like 
				nothing on Earth. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Our home planet is under more pressures all the time thanks to our actions. We may not have much time left 
				to avert (at least the worst) calamities looming in our future, by learning to act together. 
				We need a place 
				that both inspires us to do so and gives us a blank slate that makes it easier and teaches us how. 
				We need to go to the Moon.

				Moonwards is just starting out. I do the lion's share of it right now, 
				with help and inspiration here and there from 
				the good people on <a href="http://www.space.stackexchange.com">space.stackexchange</a>. I have no 
				background in the sciences, i went to art college after high school. Then to massage therapy 
				school when i realized i wasn't going to make any money from art. Then i trained at a Zen center 
				when i burned out from doing massage (which happens a lot actually - the massage burn-out part). 
				After that i, uh, sort of bounced around for a few years and eventually headed down to Mexico to try 
				to return to my artwork, where i met my husband and ended up staying. I'm still here in central 
				Mexico 13 years later. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Two years ago, in August of 2013, i finally found the diet and lifestyle that allowed me to have a 
				normal energy level. Before that i'd struggled with lethargy, dopiness, sleepiness, and accompanying 
				anxiety. It was the first time as an adult i'd been free of that for more than a couple of weeks. 
				My reaction quickly turned from 'Eureka!' to 'so now what?...'. I was in the middle of Mexico with 
				all my time free (my husband has a successful business and is happy for me to use my time as i 
				wish). I really wanted to make up for lost time.
				</p>
				<p>
				It took a while to find the right thing. I took to watching videos of successful people i admired 
				to try to figure out what direction to take. It was quickly clear that scientists and engineers were 
				my role models. One day i was watching an interview of Elon Musk - who i'd never heard of until a 
				few days before - by Salman Khan of Khan Academy.
				He started talking about going to Mars. 
				Now, starting in my early teens i'd been a big science fiction and science mag consumer, and i 
				thought 'Mars? That makes no sense. He seems like a smart guy, what's he doing?'. So i decided to 
				write up something about that. I'd started my first website, <a href="http://www.briligg.com/default">
				briligg.com</a>, a few years before. I started a section on it called 
				<a href="http://www.briligg.com/futuremoon.html">Future Moon</a>. The more i worked on that, the more 
				i got into it. If you read how its introduction reads now, you see i feel this isn't about adventure 
				or fortunes. It's about growing up as a species. Moonwards has vast potential, but it will take a 
				great deal of work for it to live up to that. By pouring myself into it, i hope i can grow up in a 
				way i didn't when i was younger because of health problems. In the same way, i believe we won't 
				find the maturity to care for our planet, and move on to greater things in our future, until we 
				pour ourselves into a project that changes our perspective and makes us see our own potential.
				</p>
				<p>
				We live in a time where we have the great fortune of learning and researching online, and working 
				with people spread over the planet. I improve my knowledge of space exploration as i work on this 
				project. I have high hopes that one way or another it will make a beneficial contribution.
