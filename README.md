# moonwards
Moonwards is a project to model a realistic path to a realistic lunar settlement with as much detail and clarity as possible. 
It starts from now and goes step by step to the point when the Moon is both independent and a major economic force. It brings real space-faring alive in people's minds by showing them what it would be like in a way they can appreciate. 
It gives the issue new weight by giving people the knowledge they need to consider what it would mean.
