						This is where one of the highest concentrations of thorium detected on the Moon is. 
						The map at right by the Lunar Prospector marks hotspots of it in white. Where 
						there is thorium, there is KREEP - Potassium, 
						Rare Earth Elements, and Phosphorus. 
						Most of the Moon has only traces of K and P, even less of REE. 
						K and P are necessary for 
						plant growth. 
						The rare earth elements neodymium and 
						samarium are used for making high-strength magnets - which in 0.16 g could do lots of neat stuff. Even better, 
						once industry is established, thorium can be used for building nuclear thermal rockets (NTRs). 
						NTRs are a lot more powerful and efficient than anything in use today, but they have never been built 
						because of the politics of radiation risk. Not a problem on the Moon.

					<span>As with all other sites that were considered, this site is on the 'shore' of a basalt mare. Both mare

					be available daily, less ideal ones almost hourly. The further you are from the equator, the less frequently 
					rendezvous in orbit is possible. (At the poles you could do it as long as you could reorient your direction 
					of launch easily, though.)

						Once the colony is really growing, there are some 
						neat things you can do here. Excavate a channel between it and Lalande, 
						and cover the entire crater with a geodesic dome. But that takes a lot of 
						infrastructure, so it will be part of later phases of construction.

						And here's Teacup Crater. To its right you can faintly see a line where the raised ground by the 
						crater rim stops, and flatter ground begins. Hopefully that would be an adequate landing spot. 
						The image here shows it has a very soft rim and no floor, the incline of its sides just meet. 
						That indicates loose material is deep enough to have slumped down its walls and fill in the floor. 
						If it wasn't right on the rim of a crater 24 km across, it would look like a crater much older than 
						Lalande. But if that was the case the impact that made Lalande would have destroyed it. At any rate,

						particles all over the planet. On the Moon, minerals probably come in layers, not veins like 
						on Earth. If you find a layer of rich ore, it probably extends over a large area. Around here the 
						jackpot is layers highly concentrated in KREEP minerals and the layer with the thorium. All around

						There is a skylight in this area. The three images show it in the mid-afternoon, morning, and at

						where the sun hits the floor of it indicates it is roughly 7 m deep. If you follow the link above 
						to Lalande and find it,
						you'll see there are spidery creases in the surface of the crater floor around it that suggest 
						<i>maybe</i> that skylight leads to a tunnel, and there are others nearby. In fact, the whole floor of 
						Lalande is covered with wrinkles and canyons highly suggestive of there being a lot of voids under 
						its surface.

						<img class="tooltip-img" src="http://moonwards.com/img/lal-lava-tube1.jpg" alt="possible lava tube">
						Here is an example of the same phenomenon as #14, much closer to Cernan's Promise. 
						These are called lava tubes, because they were made as the lava produced by the meteor 
						impact that created Lalande cooled. Or at least, these mostly look like lava <i>cracks</i>, 
						but the one on the left could be covering over a tube, perhaps. If so, it is quite long, but 
						it looks like it could be too narrow to be useful as a ready-made structure. Others might be 
						wide enough though. After 
						the creation impact, a lot of lava settled on the floor, material that was heated to molten 
						by the energy released. For a crater the 
						size of Lalande, the melt pool would have reached about 500 m deep. The question is, how 
						deep into it do these voids exist?

						These fissures go all the way from the base of the crater wall to the hill to the left 
						of the marker, about 2 km. Again, there are many examples like this around the crater 
						floor, and many long depressions that are wider but without cracks or fissures. 
						The lava of the melt pool was of low viscosity and flowed easily. So why isn't the floor 
						of the crater flat, other than occasional prominences sticking out of it?  As it cooled, some areas 
						crystallized before others. This took long enough that later events such as new impacts or 
						moonquakes caused the liquid material to shift. Based on how wrinkly and bumpy the floor is, 
						there might be voids deeper down that remain sealed.

						On either side of the marker are the domes shown in the picture. They remind me of the 
						bubbles that appear on the surface of batter or cans of paint. It makes me think of 
						lighter lava pushing up here and getting trapped by a skin of lava that has cooled more and 
						is thicker. What if some of that later drained away? That would leave a hollow dome. 
						Wouldn't that be nice? Each one of these is 200 m across. What if, just maybe, the domes 
						were created by bubbles of gas?

						These hills, which mark the central upwelling that occurs in craters of this size as the 
						ground rebounds after their creation impacts, have a lot of boulders on top of them 
						much darker than surrounding material. In this shot at midday the contrast is stark, it is less 
						noticeable in images where the sun wasn't almost right behind the camera. Kepler and Aristarchus 
						have this phenomenon too, to a lesser degree. Pockets of light material are usually explained as 
						being material that was recently exposed and thus has weathered less. Such 
						material reflects more light. Hard to fit that with the light stuff here, though. 
						Dark material? No explanation i know of. Could be volcanic glass (obsidian), but the fragments 
						are awfully large for that explanation.

						<img class="tooltip-img" src="http://moonwards.com/img/blackLalande.jpg" alt="black material in Lalande crater">
						Okay, there is one very tantalizing possible explanation, though it is very 
						preliminary. If the asteroid that impacted here and created Lalande was moving slowly enough, 
						much of its material may have remained here, instead of vaporizing and being distributed all 
						over the Moon, which is what usually happens. So, if that asteroid was a  
						chondrite (which are dark like this) these rocks 
						could have a lot of pure metals in them, especially iron and nickel. If we were especially 
						lucky, these could be the remains of a carbonaceous chondrite, containing large quantities of 
						organic molecules hinting at the secrets of the origins of the solar system and life itself. 
						Excellent for creating fertile soil and such too. What a score that would be.

						This is close to what this part of the Moon actually

						are all really where they are shown, and close to the depth or height shown. 
						The sun is where it really is during mid-morning. The rim of Lalande actually 
						drops away in the rather percipitous fashion shown. Because so much of the 
						regolith is spheroids of volcanic glass, it even has that sheen, like 
						moonlight on snow. The only part of the landscape that isn't modelled on reality is

						Here are the two main boulders of Gibraltar. The taller one is about 
						20 m high. The mound supporting the other end of the gantry crane is 
						about 15 m high. Right now the rocks that have been modelled are all shown 
						as bumps and mounds, but they are all boulders with much sharper angles. All 
						the blotches you see are boulders too - they just haven't been modelled as such 
						because there are so many. The fuzzy patches on the face of Lalande - more 
						boulders, all that stuff. This area is lousy with boulders and rocks. 
						With a little luck, a few of them will be chunks of bedrock of one pure mineral. 
						Ilmenite would be nice. If a molten metal oxide electrolysis system was set up, 
						lunar ilmenite, which is mostly oxides of iron and titanium, could be used to produce 
						oxygen, iron and titanium. Based on the composition of the regolith in the area 
						around Lalande, there is reason to hope that pure ilmenite can be found in the

						The ground outside the rim has a slope towards the east of roughly 10
						<sup>o</sup> or 15<sup>o</sup>. Just a couple hundred meters east of the rim that 
						slope makes sunset come most of an Earth-day sooner than it does on the rim. 
						Down on the crater floor the lunar day is shortened by more than 2 Earth days. The rim is 
						the best place to put anything that relies on the sun, and that includes many things

							This pile of regolith from excavation can provide feedstock for the furnaces and

							different the composition of that is from what lies on the surface. The surface regolith 
							is material from the impact blast and a lot of it could be from a kilometer or more below 
							ground. That is mostly good, since Lalande is a KREEP hotspot, as mentioned in the first image 
							at the top of the page. But it is unlikely that material is the best thing for everything. 
							Hopefully the excavated material will provide more variety, a feedstock of fines with

	 				Here is the crane-bot: some robotic arms with cameras and manipulators 
	 				('hands', basically) tele-operated from 
	 		Earth. I've just sketched something in for now, but this is really important. 
	 		Tough, powerful, and sensitive robotics suitable for 
	 		the Moon environment almost exist, and that makes everything else here viable. 
	 		Once the VMC is more developed, all stations 
	 		will be shown with the mounts where robonauts (movable robotic 'torsos' in this case) 
	 		could latch on and connect to power and data feeds, and work 
	 		on the task at hand. In this initial phase, the base has rovers with lots of robotic agility. 
	 		They or the crane can move the robonauts from station to 
	 		station or make use of them themselves for supplementary capability. Modular tool kits could 
	 		be used by any robot. 
	 		Building in this way means payload is all machinery and hardware, without any mass put 
	 		towards food, life support, 
	 		or safety. Nothing needs to return, so you save the mass of an entire ascent stage. 
	 		In fact, the rocket that gets everything 
	 		to the surface can then be torn apart for materials. 
	 		This is the biggest thing that changes the economics of the 
	 		endeavor, besides perhaps the possibility of reusable launchers.

	 			Here is the solar furnace. The half-bowl parabolic mirror has a radius of 15 m. 
	 			The mirror doesn't need to be really exact - 
	 			the tank at its focal point is large enough that small errors in its 
	 			curvature won't cause reflected light to miss it. And although it is quite big and has the shade rectangle 
	 			on one side (the thing tacked onto its left side) it isn't very heavy.

	 			The shade rectangle is a bit hard to see (it reflects only the black sky from this angle). 
	 			It is several layers of highly reflective material, 
	 			each layer separated by a small 
	 			gap. In the vacuum of space, this is the best system for insulation. Sunlight never hits all the 
	 			gear connected to the furnace tank because it hits this first and ~92% of 
	 			it reflects off it back into space. What is absorbed heats the 
	 			material of the top layer, which then starts to radiate that heat back into space in random directions, 
	 			so roughly half hits the layer below, which reflects ~92% but also heats due to that portion 
	 			it absorbs and starts randomly radiating
	 			that into space, so ~50% hits the layer after that, and so on. 
	 			In space there is no heat transfer due to convection or conduction, because there is no air, so this 
	 			kind of insulation is very effective. It protects the oxygen storage high-pressure cylinder 
	 			underneath it from sunlight all through the day. The cooler the gas is the less pressure it 
	 			exerts, so this enhances its capacity. It is also angled so that infra-red 
	 			radiation coming from the oxygen tank and its compressor are reflected skywards, 
	 			passively cooling them just a little.

	 				This is the melt-in-place bed - the MIP. 
	 				It arrives on the first mission. The techniques for working with melted basalt 
	 				will be developed here. It can use any regolith feedstock made of small grains, 
	 				which melt quickly. 
	 				The crane and rovers deliver that after screening to eliminate  
	 				chunks larger than 2 or 3 mm.
	 				In this region the regolith on the surface should be basalt, which is ideal. 
	 				Lunar basalt is really runny when fully melted, and crystallizes quickly as it cools. 
	 				With the right process it can be made 
	 				strong in both tension and compression. Near its freezing temperature 
	 				it is thick and gooey, suitable for use like plaster or glue.
	 				It should be possible to learn enough processes during Mission 1
	 				for this station to produce supports for  the solar furnace, crane, and basalt thread production 
	 				stations, saving considerable payload mass on Mission 2.

	 			Once the lava in the furnace tank has been processed as much as is useful, it is emptied into

	 			question. However much of its oxygen was successfully removed would leave behind atoms of 
	 			metal. Would they all recombine with other constituents as the lava cooled, or would some of that 
	 			metal remain elemental? How would it affect the properties of the material? Further processing of this 
	 			lava would be undertaken. The idea is it enters this vessel at above 2000 <sup>o</sup>C - more than 
	 			hot enough for numerous proposed processing methods. Basalt minerals 
	 			don't start to crystallize until 1500 <sup>o</sup>C. Perhaps if you take the lava straight to a centrifuge, 
	 			you can get the metal oxides in it to separate into layers and draw them off individually before 
	 			crystallization begins. Maybe you could even get a bit of pure metal that way, because the metal left 
	 			over by the release of oxygen won't combine to form minerals until crystallization begins. If that can 
	 			work, that would be fantastic. Purification of metals and metal oxides on the Moon is a really thorny 
	 			issue because feasible methods use multiple steps and chemicals that are rare or non-existent on the Moon, 
	 			or hydrogen, which is hard to store. If they could be gotten this way, many doors open.

	 				This is the basalt thread station. Basalt is melted and spun into thread on Earth to make very strong cloth 
	 		and cable. This is a sketch of a possible approach to the same thing on the Moon. 
	 		As on Earth, the lava flows out small holes arranged 
			around the bottom of a tank full of lava. At the right temperature, basalt lava has a very strong tendency to 
			form long strings, like molten glass does. Pull just right and those strings will keep flowing as continuous 
			strands, which can be twisted together and wound onto a spool. By sizing the tanks properly and putting the 
			right number of holes on the bottom, properly spaced out, dozens to hundreds of strands can be pulled from each, 
			for string and cord of different weights.  
			On the Moon the lava will cool more slowly because there is no air carrying heat away from it. 
			On the other hand, the low gravity means strands can hang over a much greater height without snapping under 
			their own weight. By using this to make thinner continuous strands that hang longer before being twisted 
			together, hopefully they can be cooled to the right temperature for this to work. If the process needs to be 
			more complex, it is still worth it. Being able to make cloth and cord on the Moon in large quantities would

	 			drop its temperature by over 2000 <sup>o</sup>C. 
	 			During the day thier capacity is limited by the

	 			However, once you start adding heat to the ground, it won't stay -20 <sup>o</sup>C. A mass 
	 			of warmer soil will build up around the pipes in the trench. That won't do, so at night the

						as you want to roof a dugout of any length. 
						They need to be solid basalt, preferably with a high content of iron and titanium (which 
						is widely available nearby). That's because these arches are a sneaky defense against 
						cosmic radiation that still allows a view of the sky and plenty of sunlight. 
						That is hugely beneficial psychologically and makes it much easier to grow plants. The 
						arch material needs to be dense so it stops galactic cosmic rays (really particles) better. 
						The dimensions here are based on a density of 
						3.1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. If denser material was obtained, such as pure olivine or ilmenite, the

						The dose from straight above you is quite high, 
						in the narrow corridor between arches, but off to the sides, the greater the angle the lower the 
						dose because an ever greater thickness of arches is between you and the outside. Here you have a 
						space where you can actually see the sky risk-free. If you have seen plans for Moon structures with 
						big windows or thin walls before, they were either ignoring the radiation problem or assuming stays 
						would be short. To live on the Moon, you need this kind of protection. 
						For solar flares, you'd need to retreat 
						into the hall. If sunlight is falling on you, you are in danger. But that is fine.

						is going to heat up for the first time in 100 million years. Over most of the Moon (except the poles), 
						heat doesn't move farther than that distance 
						over the course of each lunar day. Further than 80 cm underground is -20 <sup>o</sup>C all the time. 
						Because the Moon is bone dry, airless, and still, heat only diffuses. Nothing is actively carrying it away. 
						So a heat island will accumulate around the sunken hall. The cold ground is going to suck 
						up incoming heat which will steadily move away from the hall, but the further it goes, 
						the slower it goes because the heat gradient is ever less. As long as the heat is topped up 
						every day with more sunlight, the walls of the hall will stabilize at a new 
						warmer temperature determined by the natural size of that heat island and the amount of sunlight 
						received, and will vary from that only slightly each lunar day. 
						This temperature can be designed to be 21 <sup>o</sup>C. Tools: 
						Deep ditches around the hall perimeter 
						lined with reflective material. In vacuum little heat would cross such a barrier. Black floors where sun falls 
						to maximize absorption. Then just let in the right amount of sun. Remember the sun is 30 % stronger than 
						noonday tropical sun on Earth.

		 		Building a colony on the Moon requires a heavy lift vehicle that currently doesn't exist. NASA's SLS Block 2 
		 		would do nicely - as currently planned it would be just a tad bigger than a Saturn V. 
		 		Russia has considered a version of Angara that 
		 		would also serve, and China is studying such a vehicle as well to add to its Long March rocket family. These are 
		 		envisioned to be a bit smaller. SpaceX is working on its Mars Colonial Transporter, 
		 		which is planned to be considerably 
		 		bigger than any of these. A Saturn V rocket with improved engines on the upper stage 
		 		<a href="http://space.stackexchange.com/q/12859/4660">could soft-land</a> maybe 25 metric tons 
		 		on the lunar surface, of which roughly 5 tons would be the rocket and 20 tons the payload. Let's take those as our 
		 		working numbers for what is delivered by each SVE - Saturn V Equivalent.

		 		<b>Mission Objectives</b>
		 	</p>
		 	<ul class="dark">
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Landing - There is an area possibly suitable for landing about 600 m east of the Phase 1 site, with 
		 			craters 100 m wide on the east and west. The lack of an atmosphere and proximity to Earth 
		 			means landings on the Moon can be extremely precise. 
		 			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_12#Moon_Landing">Apollo 12</a> managed to land within 
		 			200 m of Surveyor III, the target destination, and that was in 1969. The patch indicated is 
		 			about 250 m across and seems to be close enough to level to serve. 
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			NTR - The survey rover (which is the big, beefy one) sets up the 
		 			nuclear thermal reactor (NTR) near the landing site. 
		 			There is a small crater about 120 m across 350 m east of the site for the base. 
		 			It is probably about 20 m deep. Setting up the reactor at the bottom of that would keep 
		 			its radiation from affecting the colony site. The survey rover is designed for serious all-terrain 
		 			roving and a small crater like that should present no trouble for it. It would place the generator, 
		 			connect the assembly bearing its radiators and microwave transmitters, place anchors around the crater rim, 
		 			attach cables from there to the radiator/transmitter mast, and tension the cables to erect the mast. 
		 			Then the fuel rods are deployed and energy begins to flow. The rover has its own solar panels and a 
		 			battery so it can set this up. Once the NTR is producing energy, the rover switches to 
		 			that source through its rectenna. Then it turns on the other rovers and they get to work.
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Tear down lander - There is no reason to make the first lander reusable. Better to tear it apart 
		 			for materials. This will have been planned for. So far, there is no clear approach for this, but 
		 			opportunities should become clear as planning advances. Certainly the supporting frame of the 
		 			lander should be stripped away immediately, to go be supports and struts in the first 
		 			installations.
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Set up Cernan's Promise - The three rovers together set up the permanent installations 
		 			and the experimental equipment. 
		 			<ul class="dark">
		 				<li>
		 					MIP station - The poles, rails and frame all have their cables pre-attached and are designed 
		 					to clip together and be stable and strong once the cables have been tensioned. The motors slot 
		 					onto the rails, poles slot into the frames of lenses on one end and into the pivoting section of 
		 					the motors on the other.	
		 				</li>
		 				<li>
		 					Solar furnace - The mirror, tank, and a short tower are set up. This will take some time. It's 
		 					also tricky, as the mirror is 15 m high from the bottom of the parabola to the height of 
		 					the rim, but by assembling the mirror ring by ring and using 
		 					all three rovers to then flip it over and put it on the tower, it can be done. At first 
		 					the tower will be too short for the mirror to rotate through its full range and it will only be 
		 					operational for the middle third of lunar days. This is sufficient for testing and experimentation. 
		 					Clip-together designs and then spot welding seems like a viable approach.  
		 				</li>
		 				<li>
		 					Test cart - All sorts of stuff will need measuring and monitoring, all sorts of prototype 
		 					designs will need to be tested. Some of that will be incorporated into the rovers themselves, 
		 					as modular units that can be swapped around or put into storage. There needs to be a place for 
		 					the prototypes and the heavier or less-used analysis equipment though. 
		 					Those pieces would benefit from some protection, at least from dust and temperature swings. 
		 					They will also need to move occasionally either to place them more conveniently or get them 
		 					out of the way. So they will be on the test cart, or can be stowed on it when not being used, 
		 					and a rover can move the cart as needed. That cart will 
		 					need a lot of design consideration once its contents are properly determined, that is for 
		 					the future. Some of its contents are shown in the 'Evaluate Prototypes' entry below.
		 				</li>
		 				<li>
		 					Winch - The winch can be easily inserted into any of the 4 bases that are sent with it, 
		 					or into a base on the survey rover. 
		 					Those bases are designed to have thick lava poured in and around them. A spot on a boulder 
		 					is picked, swept clean of particles, the base is placed on it, the lava is poured, and 
		 					once it hardens the base is set in stone. The first base goes on Gibraltar's western 
		 					boulder. The second goes on the rock outcropping about 700 m away to the west. Then 
		 					there is an area full of loose material that has flowed quite far in the past. 
		 					The survey rover can cross half of this terrain before drilling some cores, backfilling 
		 					them with lava brought from the MIP area, setting the base on those, and filling around 
		 					it as needed with further lava. That is the third base. The stone shelf about 
		 					another 900 m, beyond that begins the debris field full of giant boulders, some 100 m across on 
		 					their long axis. The fourth base (otherwise known as home plate? :P) goes on whichever 
		 					big boulder is most suitable on the west side of the shelf. At the end of this 
		 					process there is Kevlar cable strung between each base, and the rover can either keep 
		 					the winch with it and use it to haul itself up, or place the winch on a base and have it haul from 
		 					there. That way it can either have the security that the winch can haul it out of just about any 
		 					spot where it's gotten stuck, or the winch can help it bring a boulder massing many tons up 
		 					the face of Lalande to the colony base. If any of those boulders are pure olivine or ilmenite, 
		 					for example, that could be worth the trouble.
		 				</li>
		 			</ul>
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Survey rover - Off it goes to do its thing. First the immediate area around the base site - 
		 			chip all the big boulders and sample the regolith at various points, test for composition 
		 			and structure. Scan the ground with penetrating radar and 
		 			gravimeters. Make a topographical map. Outside 
		 			the rim gets surveyed first, for a kilometer or so around the base. Then with that experience 
		 			under the belt, the rover goes over the rim into Lalande itself. This may not be a big deal. 
		 			Regolith packs extremely well and flows extremely poorly. In the low gravity, descending an 
		 			incline of 40<sup>o</sup> might be a piece of cake. But the rover will stay connected to the 
		 			winch and install the winch bases going down the face of Lalande as its first task. Then it 
		 			can spend time experimenting until how to rove safely is clear. Even if that is difficult, by 
		 			using the winch bases and cable, it can get to the firm-looking and less-steep ground beside 
		 			the debris field safely cabled, and from there the roving seems clear all the way to the crater 
		 			floor and on the edges of its melt pool. On that melt pool, solidified melt might be less than a 
		 			half meter below the surface. Around it, bedrock could be a couple of meters from the surface. 
		 			There are ridges around where bedrock is likely exposed. No lunar mission has ever been on ground 
		 			like this, surprises are probable. There is a decent chance something quite exciting will be found, 
		 			and it might be a lucky thing that the rover together with the winches can haul up pretty massive 
		 			things.
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			MIPs at work - 
		 			Rovers collect the loose powder regolith 
		 			from the surrounding area, screen it to desired particle sizes, 
		 			and help smooth and tamp it so it melts as evenly as possible. In concert with the 
		 			motorized arms on the rails, which aim the light of the lenses and track it along 
		 			the desired paths, they perform a broad range of melt experiments on the regolith, rocks, and samples 
		 			brought by the survey rover. 
		 				<ul class="dark">
		 					<li>
		 					Crucibles and pots of regolith samples are melted to characterize their properties at 
		 					various temperatures, from low to high viscosity. Drawing strands from 
		 					molten basalt samples is of special interest to establish how to produce fibers suitable 
		 					for making cord and cloth.
		 					</li>
		 					<li>
		 						Molds for a set of standard shapes create samples that can be tested for 
		 						gross physical characteristics - with a focus on suitability as construction materials. 
		 					</li>
		 					<li>
		 						Shapes melted in place are equally tested for physical properties, and later, experimented 
		 						with to determine methods of joining, shaping, cutting, and bending them.  
		 					</li>
		 					<li>
		 						Equipment for examining both samples made here, and ones brought by the survey rover,  
		 						tests composition, crystal structure, and other properties. 
		 					</li>
		 					<li>
		 						Once sufficient experimentation has been done, attempts to build objects begin. 
		 						Possible methods: 
		 						<ul>
		 							<li>A 3d printing approach - smoothing an area of regolith, 
		 							melting a path in it that is less than a 
		 							centimeter deep, spreading a new layer of regolith over that of similar thickness, 
		 							melting a path in that, and thus 
		 							building up objects layer by layer. Similar
		 							to <a href="http://www.markuskayser.com/">this prototype</a> by Markus Kayser. 
		 							</li>
		 							<li>Taking stock shapes like rods and panels and cutting and joining them. For large 
		 							items, this is much faster than 3d printing and could be stronger.
		 							</li>
		 						</ul>
		 					</li>
		 				</ul>
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Solar Furnace - The mirror 
		 			has a lower support tower that can be extended on mission 2, when 
		 			the crane needed to assemble it on that scale arrives. 
		 			It tests how a charge of regolith evolves when held at a high temperature for an extended period. 
		 			It tests electrolysis technology for production of oxygen and metals. 
		 			It experiments with beneficiating regolith to obtain feedstocks suitable for refining out pure 
		 			minerals (such as alumina, magnesia, or silica), and otherwise separating constituent molecules.
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Test Consruction methods:
		 			<ul class="dark">
				 		<li>
				 			Sunken hall part one: Retaining wall: When the survey rover is free, 
				 			use it to begin excavation on an experimental scale. It has a 
				 			small digging bucket and the means to anchor itself for good purchase in the soil, 
				 			but under the top layer, regolith is hard-packed and quite hard to dig. A Fresnel 
				 			lens specialized to focus sunlight into a row of points will help it with that material. 
				 			Scanning across a surface with it melts a row of grooves into the soil, making it easier to 
				 			break up and remove. 
				 			Create a pit with walls angled 70<sup>o</sup> or so. Assess the stability of these 
				 			walls as the pit deepens. Turn the pit face into a retaining wall by driving a grid of 
				 			stakes into it, fusing those to basalt planks and panels, and parging and spattering lava over 
				 			the resulting surface.
				 			<br> 
				 			<i>(Note: the survey rover is the biggest rover, and it will be testing the technology for 
				 			the digger rover upgrade it will get with kit arriving on mission 2.)</i>
				 		</li>
				 		<li>
				 			Sunken hall part two: Arched roof: Create arches of fused regolith at the 
				 			MIP station. Span the width of the 
				 			retaining wall pit with the arches, lay planks across them, parge the planks with lava, and pile 
				 			regolith on top to a depth of at least 1.5 m. So, the width of the pit has to be enough for 
				 			this to be a meaningful experiment. The priority would be to make it deep enough to be a valid 
				 			test of the retaining wall concept, and wide enough to test the arch concept. The planks and beams 
				 			can be made scale versions of the calculated dimensions for a much larger pit and arch construction.
				 		</li>
				 	</ul>
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Evaluate prototypes:
		 			<ul class="dark">
		 				<li>
		 				Molten Metal Oxide Electrolysis - 
		 				<a href="http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110008535.pdf">
		 				Sirk and Sadoway</a> did work on this recently. Take a quantity of molten regolith, 
		 				run a current through it between a cathode and anode of the right materials, and 
		 				oxygen will gather at the anode while the metals it was formerly bonded to gather 
		 				at the cathode. The pyrolysis process used in the solar furnace - oxygen creation 
		 				through very high temperatures - would be preferable as the power is free, being 
		 				sunlight. But it might be easier to get metals from an electrolysis process.
		 				</li>
		 				<li>
		 				Magnetic Separation and Microwave Sintering of Powder Regolith - 
		 				<a href="http://www.isruinfo.com/docs/microwave_sintering_of_lunar_soil.pdf">Taylor and Meek</a> 
		 				have pioneered this. The link is to a really interesting paper that looks at why the lunar 
		 				regolith absorbs microwave energy so strongly, and just how great a menace the very fine, 
		 				abrasive powder regolith is. Most regolith grains have a patina of pure iron, it turns out, 
		 				which causes them to react to a magnet. This can be used for dust control, which is going to be 
		 				very important. That same patina causes their strong absorption of microwaves, and thus 
		 				a microwave emitter can cause a depth of regolith to partially melt and the grains to weld 
		 				together pretty efficiently. An emitter scanned across the ground might be capable of 
		 				causing this effect down to a depth of 50 cm, creating a very strong and durable 
		 				monolithic material in one step. With any kinks worked out of the prototype, 
		 				this might be helpful for reinforcing the walls of sunken halls, for instance.
		 				</li>
		 				<li>
		 				Induction Heating Vaporization and Isotope Separation via Magnetic Field - 
		 				<a href="http://enu.kz/repository/2010/AIAA-2010-8703.pdf">Schubert et al.</a> have done 
		 				work on a thing that might do it all: extract oxygen, separate out a series of pure metals 
		 				all at once according to their atomic masses, and leave slag useful as refractory material. 
		 				The technique is much less explored than that of electrolysis and could need a lot more 
		 				development. From the looks of it, potentially the induction heating coils in part of it 
		 				could be replaced by highly intense sunlight (wherever that is possible it just seems like 
		 				it should be done).
		 				</li>
		 				<li>
		 				Effects of Centrifugal Force on High-Temperature Molten Regolith - Alright, i just want to 
		 				do this. If you heat regolith to well beyond the temperature at which all the minerals in it 
		 				melt, and then you subject it to several gravities of force, will layers form in it? Because 
		 				that sure would be useful, if you could drain off those layers individually 
		 				before they cool enough to start crystallizing. They would be pure metal oxides, several of 
		 				which can be turned into useful products fairly easily: magnesia to refractory brick and 
		 				coatings, alumina to sapphire, silica to quartz.
		 				</li>
		 			</ul>
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Landing area preparation - As the date for Mission 2 draws near, it would be helpful to create a 
		 			crude landing pad by melting the top of the regolith on a patch the coming rocket can then aim for. 
		 			It might help to clear the loose powder layer before doing this.

		 		<b>Mission Objectives Lalande</b>
		 	</p>
		 	<ul class="dark">
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Erect the gantry crane. That could require temporarily taking down the MIP - the crane is really big and it 
		 			will take all the rovers plus the crane itself to get it done.
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Erect the full-size solar furnace. That thing is big too. The components are light, but the tower is high. 
		 			The crane will be critical to getting it put together properly. Once it is installed and operating, it 
		 			begins to produce oxygen and oxide chemicals that can be refined later into pure phosphorus, potassium, 
		 			sodium, and sulphur. During this construction phase, its great heating capability can be applied more 
		 			to producing lava in high volume, in particular for making the blocks for the arches over the dugout.
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Send the Lalande Exploration Rover (LER) down inside the crater - It is going to concentrate on the 
		 			crater floor, entering the cracks in the lava and seeking lava tubes. Depending on how stable the 
		 			surface of the melt pond is, the survey rover (which is now focused on construction), may have 
		 			already explored and mapped much of it. There is a risk of subsurface voids covered by a 
		 			thin sheet of melt or debris which would collapse under the weight of the survey rover, 
		 			so it may not have been able to go far (though it will have equipment to detect such things). 
		 			The LER is much lighter and will be designed to be able to climb, and perhaps jump.
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 		Build a very basic road from rim to floor -  That is, clear the boulders and the powder regolith along a wide path, 
		 		melt and sinter the top layer of regolith, for dust control and better traction. The general purpose rovers can 
		 		do this. As they progress they can remove the cables that were installed to ensure the safety of the survey 
		 		rover, and that cable can be used elsewhere. 
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Set up the basalt fiber plant - This will have been designed based on the experiments of mission 1. It has to have 
		 			the right-sized pores on the bottom of the molten basalt tanks, which are kept at the right temperature, 
		 			gently pressing 
		 			down just the right amount to keep the lava flowing gently through the pores, which hang over just the right distance 
		 			to cool to a sort of fiberglass and not snap, and then have sizing applied (about 0.5% of the 
		 			final product would be sizing), be gently twined together, and wound onto 
		 			spools with just the right force to 
		 			keep the process going. Hopefully, this recipe exists. If it doesn't, placing the 
		 			system inside a thin atmosphere may help by enhancing heat dissipation, and it would 
		 			also create the option of using blowing techniques used on Earth for certain basalt fiber 
		 			products. It can be done, based on the product on Earth that much 
		 			is certain. It is very possible that the anhydrous (water-free) nature of lunar basalt will make fibers 
		 			of it even stronger than Earth-side basalt fibers, whose tensile strength varies between 3 and 4.8 GPa.
		 			My best guess is that the tanks will be high up and the strands will hang to cool over a considerable distance 
		 			before being twined together. That is the design shown in the previous section. 
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Excavate the dugout - The fresnel lenses will help with this by melting channels in the regolith so 
		 			the digger (formerly the survey rover) has an easier time breaking it up. A big, specialized 
		 			lens system will be suspended above the gantry crane on its own rail to help with that. The digger is also going to 
		 			anchor itself to Gibraltar so it can bite into the ground at full strength without just tipping over 
		 			instead of lifting out a chunk of soil. Apparently the ground below the first meter or so is packed 
		 			so tight there is only 10% voids in it. Lunar regolith is famous for being 
		 			strangely hard-packed. There is a bucket design for excavators that is used on 
		 			solid rock - a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCsFvUE5yFE">multi-ripper</a>. 
		 			That sounds like a good idea. The gantry crane will lift out the debris. 
		 			There will be boulders embedded 
		 			in the regolith. It would be nice if by focussing a large Fresnel lens onto them 
		 			they could be made to crack some. Maybe not. Anyhow the multi-ripper bucket should be able to 
		 			either claw them out or slowly reduce them to rubble. 
		 			The dugout is going to be 
		 			about 60 m north to south and 30 m wide at the top. The walls angle in at a high degree so that 
		 			the volume to be excavated is greatly reduced, and also so that mirrored surfaces on those walls will 
		 			reflect the sky into the sunken hall that will extend from there. Gotta keep 
		 			that big lovely globe of the Earth in sight. It will be about 20 m deep. At the bottom it will be 
		 			about 10 m wide by 30 m long.
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Reinforce and seal the dugout walls - The MIPs will be working away producing various pieces of 
		 			construction material. One type of product is planks and panels with small spikes on one side that 
		 			can be set against an excavated face of the dugout, and pounded into it so the spikes sink in and it stays 
		 			put. Then a layer of thick lava can be parged, spattered, or poured over it, and you get a continuous 
		 			layer of stone once it all cools to solid. The spikes on the panels could be created by just by dipping 
		 			into the surface of a molten layer and pulling upwards when it is at the right temperature - very thick, 
		 			almost set.
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Lay beams across the dugout - The MIPs will also be producing the blocks that go in the arches over the 
		 			dugout. A scaffold will be needed so that a set of blocks can be laid by the crane, forming a complete arch. 
		 			Then lava can be poured in grooves left along each end face of the blocks to join them. There is also a  
		 			groove along the top of each block, so that later a thick basalt fiber cable can be laid there and tensioned. 
		 			That is how the arches will have the strength to contain an atmosphere once the dugout and hall are complete.
		 		</li>
		 		<li class="black">
		 			Excavate the sunken hall - The excavation lens system is needed here especially, as it 
		 			can redirect the light from the main lens over a range of angles and adjust the focal distance of the 
		 			system. By working towards the middle from both the side under the 
		 			dugout, and the side facing Lalande, work can go faster. 
		 			On the dugout side, the crane helps by installing reinforcing ribs on the roof and walls of the 
		 			excavated area. The general purpose rovers can 
		 			start on the Lalande face doing prep until the digger has gone as far as makes sense on the dugout 
		 			side. As the Lalande side is on a slope, the excavation lens can be effective there over a larger 
		 			portion of the day, and reach deeper inside. The GP rovers can clear loose material, build a 
		 			scaffold for the excavation lens system to 
		 			have proper mobility, and haul excavated material out and install the reinforcing ribs
		 			once the digger starts on that face. Once the hall is done, it is about 50 m long, 20 m wide, 
		 			and 12 m high at the top of the arch.

		 		<b>Mission Objectives</b>
		 	</p>
		 	<p class="black">
		 		This mission 
				design assumes that space agencies have already done most of the ground work. As has already 
				been studied (but not committed to), it assumes space agency missions have: produced high-detail 
				maps of polar volatile resources, done missions on the surface that established 
				the structure and nature of volatile-containing regolith, and done preliminary experiments on 
				methods to extract those resources. 
		 		Much here parallels the <a href="http://lunarcots.com/">LunarCOTS</a> design 
		 		by Doug Plata, and the 
		 		<a href="http://www.cislunarnext.org/Site/Home.html">Cislunar Space Next</a> 
		 		design by <a href="http://www.cislunarnext.org/Site/Home.html">Paul Spudis</a>. 
		 	</p>
			<p class="black">
		 		A major difference from the above mission architectures is that an orbiting fuel depot is a low 
		 		priority and entirely optional. There are other players who may establish a fuel depot, and it 
		 		seems quite plausible that it would be better left to them. 
		 		Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries 
		 		both see that as an early revenue stream and a support to further their own 
		 		activities. SpaceX, armed with a fully developed reusable rocket, 
		 		would have the option of creating their own depot and using launches to it 
		 		to prove out the reliability of those rockets, and create infrastructure for the 
		 		Mars Colonial Transporter (even though settling the Moon is really a much better idea 
		 		in the near term). 
		 		Deliveries to such a depot might provide good revenue if the market is big enough, but that 
		 		market could take a while to develop and may never be very big - by the time there is enough 
		 		traffic in space that it would be a profitable business for various players, alternative engines that 
		 		use other fuels or far less fuel could mean they don't want much of your product. Possibilities along 
		 		these lines include: nuclear engines, solar electric engines, solar sails, tether systems. 
		 		In three of these four cases, Cernan's Promise could be who brings on this competition. Refinement of 
		 		thorium to fuel nuclear rockets, launch services for solar sails (unfolding and deploying the sail before 
		 		releasing the craft), and tether systems are all part of the longer-range plan (but not so very long).
		 	</p>
		 	<p class="black">
		 		Fuel production is for the shuttles, which 
		 		rendezvous in orbit with ships from Earth, have payload transferred to them, and return to the 
		 		surface. Later they would do the same for people arriving and departing. A space station at 
		 		EML1 is a priority that comes after that, as it opens many possibilities, and they would then 
		 		shuttle between there and destinations on the lunar surface. 
				What follows is one possible methodology for obtaining the raw materials for that fuel (and 
				for many other applications).
				It may be that a different digging approach would be better, or some method of heating 
				the ground and then capturing the vapors it sheds. As always, the plan will be refined and altered 
				as more information becomes available.
		 	</p>
			<ul class="dark">
				<li class="black">
				Deploy comms satellites - this occurs when the final stage 
				and lander are in orbit, before the landing sequence starts. 
				One satellite is released, then the other, such that they are spaced as far apart in their orbits 
				as possible. In order for these satellites to give the best (hopefully 
				continuous) coverage, they need to be put in an orbit that is very high when it is over the south pole, and 
				as low as possible over the north pole. That way they spend most of their time in range of the south pole, 
				because they are moving more slowly in that part of their orbit. And if one isn't in range, then another is. 
				This is necessary because at the poles sometimes the Earth is out of view and then a satellite is needed to relay 
				radio signals.
				</li>
				<li class="black">
				Deploy solar panels - The rovers unload the solar panels and set them up, running on the power of 
				their radioisotope thermal generator to do this. Once the panels are up the rovers receive a 
				big power boost by combining their internal power with power beamed from there as microwaves.
				</li>
				<li class="black">
				Scout PSR - This area will have been extensively surveyed already, but the 
				rovers should go over the terrain and poke around a bit, to decide exactly how to start, test all their 
				systems, and so on.
				</li>
				<li class="black">
				Load a heater and let it work - The idea is that their are a series of large tanks the rovers fill with 
				regolith they've dug up. The regolith, hopefully, will be composed of 10% or more volatile chemicals, 
				mostly water ice. Once one tank is full, it is taken up and set in the sun. It has a tight seal to hold 
				in the vapors that quickly appear. A pump sends the vapors to a chiller and on to a holding tank, and 
				a condenser plate captures water and trickles it into a holding tank. 
				</li>
				<li class="black">
				Distil gasses and liquids - The gasses will be a mix of a 
				number of things, the water will have a lot of contanminants. They are taken to the distillation 
				unit and the various chemicals are purified and stored separately. 
				</li>
				<li class="black">
				Electrolyse part of the water - Split the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen and store the gasses 
				in separate tanks. This should probably wait until the shuttle is largely loaded with 
				water and tanks of other volatiles. The tank contents will need to be liquefied in order to serve as 
				rocket fuel, and because the boiling point of H<sub>2</sub> is so low, -253 <sup>o</sup>C, if this is 
				done too soon much of it will be lost because it boils off. 
				</li>
				<li class="black">
				Chill to liquid states - This step could have some interesting wrinkles. The permanently shadowed regions 
				of the Moon are very, very cold. The pressure tanks of the various gasses taken from the distiller could 
				simply be left there in some nook to passively cool, and most of the chemicals would condense on their 
				own. <a href="http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/trs/_techrep/TM-2010-216120.pdf"> This 
				feasibility study</a> on liquefying oxygen on the Moon looked at connecting the equipment for that 
				directly to the 
				electrolyzer unit. At the poles it might be better not to put such equipment in the deep 
				cold of a PSR, so it would be 
				put first in a pressure tank at the electolyser station in the sun. 
				The study showed that the oxygen, and so presumably also the hydrogen, 
				would need to go through drying to remove remaining water contamination. So, both chemicals would 
				go through a series of radiations and dryers until they liquefy, and then they would be placed 
				in tanks.
				</li>
				<li class="black">
				Store until time to transport, then load - Again, the thing to do would be to simply leave them 
				where the cold is so deep they stay liquid. During transport they will heat up some because the 
				shuttle is warm, though the shuttle hold will be in vacuum and have some insulation, which helps. 
				As the trip is a sub-orbital hop, best to make it late at night so the shuttle spends most of 
				the trip in shadow.
				</li>
				<li class="black">
				Fly the shuttle to Cernan's Promise - This is a big day. I mean, all the stuff planned is 
				hugely meaningful, but you know how rockets are. Very finicky things. The environment at the 
				lunar poles helps some in this case - in the sunny PEL where the shuttle will sit awaiting 
				departure time the temperature doesn't vary much, so it undergoes much less stress due to 
				expansion and contraction of all its many complex pieces. It should probably have a little 
				tent to make that temperature fluctuation even smaller and reduce dust and static charge 
				buildup. Aerojet Rocketdyne have developed the CECE engine, the required liquid hydrogen / 
				liquid oxygen engine, designed for 50 restarts. No liquid-fuel engine up to this point has 
				ever been restarted so often, much less after sitting on a planet for a number of months. But 
				one can't help but think something very much like this mission is what NASA had in mind when 
				it asked Aerojet Rocketdyne to develop the engine. It is hard to think of another reason why 
				NASA would want to restart an engine so many times. Perhaps the contract went out during the 
				warm glow of the Constellation Program days.
