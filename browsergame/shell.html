<p>If you are trying to play this game without JavaScript, you are having a bad problem and will not go to space today.</p>
<p>However, consider allowing scripts here, the scripts are for nothing but the game, no trackers or anything. There is localStorage however, but that is for creating a savefile. The game works just as fine if you turn it off. Type "nosave" in the squacky to turn of localStorage usage.</p>
</noscript>
<p>If you are reading this paragraph, you have a development version of the game. Do not expect anything to work</p>
