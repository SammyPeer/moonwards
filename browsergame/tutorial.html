<h1>Tutorial</h1>
<p>Omg! It is a text based game!<br>
Yep! The developer knows more math than design.<br>
You actually have to type <i>commands</i> to do stuff...<br>
Basic gameplay consist of researching new technologies and buy hardware.<br>
Once you have a sufficient amount of equipment on the Moon, you can start doing stuff with it.<br><br>
A good place to start is researching some technology. Type "rd" in the command line<br>
Other important places are "launch", "shop" and TBD.
</p>
<p>This is your goal:</p>
<img src="images/moon.gif" onmouseover="this.style.transform='rotateZ(12deg)'" onmouseout="this.style.transform='rotateZ(0deg)'">
<h2>Details</h2>
<h4>Budget</h4>
<p>You have a budget of money to spend. Each 100 unit of time, it is replenished.<br>
Be careful about how much money you spend. You can go below zero, but then a 1% fine is added every 5 time unit.<br>
Your budget is shown in red below the current time.</p>
<h4>Time</h4>
<p>The current time is shown in grey. You can fast forward with the buttons below it.</p>
<h4>In short</h4>
<p>Buy parts, stick them together, and launch into space.<br>Then navigate towards the Moon, land and build a base.<br>That is not more complicated than in real life.</p>

<p>The text on this page is centre-aligned, because that is a cool layout.<br>
Do not tell my anything about CSS!
